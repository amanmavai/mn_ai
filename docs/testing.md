I want bulletproof testing for our finance tracker. Here's what I'm thinking:

- Unit tests for all utility functions (currency formatting, date calculations, validation)
- Component tests using React Testing Library for every UI component
- Integration tests for our API endpoints with proper database setup/teardown
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows like adding transactions and viewing reports
- Performance tests to ensure the app stays fast as data grows

Set up the testing infrastructure with proper configuration, then write comprehensive tests for our existing features. I want to be confident that changes won't break anything.
