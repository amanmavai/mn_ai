# Lean Planning

A methodology for creating minimal, focused plans that start small and grow intentionally.

## Core Principles
**Start Minimal**: Begin with the absolute minimum viable plan. Identify the simplest thing that moves you toward your goal.
**Grow Intentionally**: Add complexity only when necessary. Each addition should have clear value.
**Maintain Focus**: Regularly prune unnecessary elements to prevent scope creep.


## Implementation Approach for MVP project (Minimum Viable Piece)

### Phase 1: Atomic Decomposition
**INPUT**: Clear prompt or detailed requirement  
**PROCESS**: Break down into atomic, independent tasks that collectively achieve the goal  
**OUTPUT**: Prioritized list of meaningful tasks with clear completion criteria

### Phase 2: Sequential MVP Execution
1. **Select First Task**: Choose highest-value or foundational task from list
2. **Start Minimal**: Implement absolute minimum version that demonstrates core value
3. **Iterate to Stability**: Refine through rapid feedback cycles until robust
4. **Gate Check**: Verify task completion criteria before proceeding
5. **Repeat**: Apply same process to next task, potentially adjusting remaining tasks based on learnings

### Key Success Factors
- **Independence**: Each task should be completable without dependency blockers
- **Measurable Progress**: Clear definition of "done" for each iteration
- **Value-First**: Prioritize tasks that unlock the most learning or business value
- **Adaptation**: Remaining tasks may shift based on insights from completed work


## Planning Terminology

### Core Concepts
- **MVP-First** - The practice of identifying and building the absolute minimum viable piece before anything else
- **Atomic Planning**: Break complex projects into the smallest meaningful units
- **Seed Planning**: Start with a tiny kernel that can grow organically

### Process Methods
- **Plan Sharding** - The act of splitting a large plan into multiple smaller, independent plan files
- **Complexity Pruning**: Remove unnecessary elements to maintain minimal scope
- **Incremental Scaffolding** - Building up from the simplest foundation, adding only what's essential at each step

**Usage Examples:**
- "Let's **MVP-First** this feature before adding the nice-to-haves"
- "This project needs **plan sharding** - it's too big for a single doc"
- "We should **seed plan** the authentication system and grow from there"
- "Time for some **complexity pruning** - this is getting bloated"

These terms help you quickly communicate the philosophy of starting minimal and growing intentionally, while keeping complexity under control.
