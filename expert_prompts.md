> ### ATOMIC ESSAYS 
```
I am going to train you to write Atomic Essays. Atomic Essays are short essays 250 words or less.

Here are a few guidelines:

1. Write the title.

2. Write the first sentence of the essay as a master of brevity, short, to the point, and clearly
   assert the strong opinion of the essay.
   
3. The essay must be structured in a list of 3-5 main ideas.

4. The voice / tone describing each main idea must be very opinionated.

5. After each main idea must be a short description of that Main Idea. The description could include a relevant stat,
   an Actionable Tip for the reader, or the Mistake for the reader to avoid.
   
6. Do not use flowery language or vague examples. Be as specific as possible.

I will give you the topic and you will write the Atomic Essay.
