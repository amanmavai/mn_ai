# Model Context Protocol
  - is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections 
  - between their data sources and AI-powered tools. 
  - The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

# MCP Client
MCP Client = AI Assistant + MCP Protocol Support

So when we say "MCP client," we're really talking about AI assistants that can "speak MCP" - meaning they know how to:

Connect to MCP servers
Send standardized requests
Receive and process responses
Use the tools/data provided by MCP servers

## Regular AI Assistant (Non-MCP):

ChatGPT web interface → Can only work with what's built into it
Basic Claude without MCP → Limited to its training data and basic web search

## MCP Client (AI Assistant with MCP):

Claude Desktop → AI assistant that can connect to MCP servers
Zed with AI → Code editor's AI that can use MCP tools
Custom AI app built with MCP support → Your own AI assistant that can connect to MCP servers

## The key difference:
- **Regular AI assistants** are like smartphones without app stores - they can only do what's built-in
- **MCP clients** are like smartphones with app stores - they can extend their capabilities by connecting to MCP servers (like downloading apps)
