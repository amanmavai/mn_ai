A **written specification** aligns humans.

Its **the artifact** that you communicate, discuss, debate, refer to and sync on.

If you don't have a written specification, you just have a **vague idea**.

SPEC > CODE

LOSS-LESS FAN-OUT

Communication - the work we all already do - 
embodied in a specification is better than code.

Specification => models = Typescript, Rust, Ios apps, servers, clients, documentation, tutorials, blog posts, even podcasts.

# Bottleneck Shift
The new scarce skill is wrting specs that fully capture intent and values.

Whoever masters that becomes the most valuable programmer.
