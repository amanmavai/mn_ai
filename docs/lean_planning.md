Here are some jargon terms that capture these planning principles:

## Planning Jargon

**Core Terms:**
- **MVP-First** - The practice of identifying and building the absolute minimum viable piece before anything else
- **Atomic Planning** - Breaking down complex projects into the smallest indivisible planning units
- **Seed Planning** - Starting with the tiniest viable kernel of a plan that can grow organically

**Process Terms:**
- **Plan Sharding** - The act of splitting a large plan into multiple smaller, independent plan files
- **Complexity Pruning** - Actively removing unnecessary elements to maintain minimal scope
- **Incremental Scaffolding** - Building up from the simplest foundation, adding only what's essential at each step

**Usage Examples:**
- "Let's **MVP-First** this feature before adding the nice-to-haves"
- "This project needs **plan sharding** - it's too big for a single doc"
- "We should **seed plan** the authentication system and grow from there"
- "Time for some **complexity pruning** - this is getting bloated"

These terms help you quickly communicate the philosophy of starting minimal and growing intentionally, while keeping complexity under control.


## Planning Guidelines
- **minimal**: figure out the absolute minimum plan first towards achieving the end goal. (i.e. figure out the simplest thing first and you grow from there towards the end goal). being minimal is necessary to contain unnecessary complexity.


## Example Plan for implementing Page P1
Plan the implementation in multiple iterations depending on the complexity of the page, for medium complexity, we can plan in 3 iterations
