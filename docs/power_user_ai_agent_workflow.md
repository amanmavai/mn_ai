# ai-agent workflow
1. ask claude to make a plan before it starts to code, run it by you first.
eg: here is the problem I wanna solve, before you code brainstorm some ideas and make me a list of ideas for how to approach it
and dotn't write any code yet. it can give use multiple options to choose from. we can combine few options if we like them.
2. ask claude to use extended thinking, this works best if claude has context already, ask it to read files first and pause, ask it to think and brainstorm some ideas and then I will ask it to write code.
